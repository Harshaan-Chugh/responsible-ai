# RAI
Project Requires Redis. Redis can be downloaded using the .msi file at: https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases/tag/win-3.2.100  
Please also run pip install -r requirements.txt, as you most likely need the redis version for python too.

The GUI is currently designed around 1920x1080 displays (the Cisco Laptop, and may have issues with scaling to other device sizes)
