Here is a quick example of how RAI can be used without the dashboard to calculate and report on the metrics for a machine learning task

ResponsibleAI\demos\tabular_class_console.py

.. code-block:: bash

 import os
 import sys
 import inspect
 import pandas as pd
 from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
 from RAI.AISystem import AISystem, Model
 from RAI.Analysis import AnalysisManager
 from RAI.dataset import NumpyData, Dataset
 from RAI.utils import df_to_RAI
 import numpy as np
 from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

- It starts by importing the necessary libraries

**Get Dataset**

.. code-block:: python

 train_data = pd.read_csv(data_path + "train.csv", header=0, skipinitialspace=True, na_values="?")
 test_data = pd.read_csv(data_path + "test.csv", header=0, skipinitialspace=True, na_values="?")
 all_data = pd.concat([train_data, test_data], ignore_index=True)

- Get X and y data, as well as RAI Meta information from the Dataframe
- Create Data Splits and pass them to RAI
- Create Model and RAIs representation of it
- Create RAI AISystem to pass all relevant data to RAI
- Train the model, generate predictions
- View results computed by RAI

.. code-block:: python


 ai.display_metric_values(display_detailed=True)
 analysis = AnalysisManager()
 result = analysis.run_analysis(ai, "test", "FairnessAnalysis")
 print(result["FairnessAnalysis"].to_string())

 ==== Group Fairness Analysis Results ====
 1 of 4 tests passed.

 Statistical Parity Difference Test:
 This metric is The difference of the rate of favorable outcomes received by the unprivileged group to the privileged group.
 The idea value is 0.0.
 It's value of -0.11160752641979553 is not between between 0.1 and -0.1 indicating that there is unfairness.

 Equal Opportunity Difference Test:
 This metric is The difference of true positive rates between the unprivileged and the privileged groups.
 The true positive rate is the ratio of true positives to the total number of actual positives for a given group.
 The ideal value is 0. A value of < 0 implies higher benefit for the privileged group and a value > 0 implies higher benefit for the unprivileged group.
 It's value of -0.12121212121212122 is not between between 0.1 and -0.1 indicating that there is unfairness.

 Average Odds Difference Test:
 This metric is The average difference of false positive rate (false positives / negatives) and true positive rate (true positives / positives) between unprivileged and privileged groups.
 The ideal value is 0.  A value of < 0 implies higher benefit for the privileged group and a value > 0 implies higher benefit for the unprivileged group..
 It's value of -0.08017127799736495 is between between 0.1 and -0.1 indicating that there is fairness.

 Disparate Impact Ratio Test:
 This metric is The ratio of rate of favorable outcome for the unprivileged group to that of the privileged group.
 The ideal value of this metric is 1.0 A value < 1 implies higher benefit for the privileged group and a value > 1 implies a higher benefit for the unprivileged group.
 It's value of 0.2581382067390062 is not between between 1.25 and 0.8 indicating that there is unfairness.
