**Introduction**

- RAI is an easy-to-use framework for Responsible AI development. By providing models and their generations, RAI can handle all metric computation and perform live visualization on its dashboard.
- RAI can also be used entirely from the console, allowing users working through command line to take advantage of its tools.
- RAI is built to handle a large variety of models and datatypes like text, images, tabular data, etc.
- Based on the type of model, data, and task provided by the user, RAI automatically determines what metrics are relevant.
- Visualization tools built into RAI give users a strong sense of how their model performs and allows for in depth analysis and optimization. 
- RAI provides metrics that measure various aspects of AI systems, including performance, robustness, explainability, and fairness. 
- Emphasis was placed on making each metric simple to understand and visualize, allowing anyone to get a strong idea of their model's strengths and weaknesses and understand what needs to change.

Here's a quick example of using RAI without a dashboard for calculating and reporting on machine learning metrics.

- It starts by importing the necessary libraries
